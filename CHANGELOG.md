## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   Autocrafting Monitor

### Changed

-   The Autocrafting Monitor now has a sidebar with all tasks instead of using tabs.

## [2.0.0-milestone.4.9] - 2024-11-01

### Added

-   Autocrafter Manager
-   You can now configure the view type of the Autocrafter Manager:
    -   Visible (only show autocrafters that are configured to be visible to the Autocrafter Manager)
    -   Not full (only show autocrafters that are not full yet)
    -   All (show all autocrafters)

### Changed

-   The search field in the Autocrafter Manager can now search in:
    -   Pattern inputs
    -   Pattern outputs
    -   Autocrafter names
    -   All of the above (by default)
-   Due to technical limitations and the new filtering options listed above being client-side only, you can no longer shift-click patterns in the Autocrafter Manager.
-   In the Autocrafter, you can now configure whether it is visible to the Autocrafter Manager (by default it's visible).

## [2.0.0-milestone.4.8] - 2024-10-12

### Added

-   Autocrafter
    -   Note: autocrafting itself hasn't been implemented yet. This is the in-game content, but not the autocrafting engine itself yet. 
-   The Relay now has support for propagating autocrafting when not in pass-through mode.

### Changed

-   The Crafter has been renamed to "Autocrafter".

-   Custom titles that overflow will now have a marquee effect instead, for every GUI.
-   You can now define a priority in the Autocrafter.
-   You can now change the name of a Autocrafter in the GUI.
-   Changed "Crafter mode" to "Locking mode" with following options:
    -   Never
    -   Lock until redstone pulse is received
    -   Lock until connected machine is empty (new, facilitates easier "blocking mode" without redstone)
    -   Lock until all outputs are received (new, facilitates easier "blocking mode" without redstone)
    -   Lock until low redstone signal
    -   Lock until high redstone signal
-   Resources in the Grid that are autocraftable now display an orange backdrop and tooltip to indicate whether the resource is autocraftable at a glance.
-   Slots used in the Pattern Grid for pattern encoding and Crafting Grid crafting matrix slots now display an orange backdrop and tooltip to indicate whether the item is autocraftable at a glance. This checks patterns from your network and from your inventory.
-   Added help tooltip for filtering based on recipe items in the Crafting Grid.
-   The crafting amount and crafting preview screens have been merged. Changing the amount will update the live preview.
-   The numbers on the crafting preview screen are now compacted with units.
-   When requesting autocrafting multiple resources at once, which can happen via a recipe mod, all the crafting requests are now listed on the side of the GUI.

### Changed

    the network signal from the input network will be passed through as-is to the output side.
-   When the "pass-through" mode on the Relay is off, the network signal from the input network will no longer be passed
    through as-is to the output side, but you can choose to pass the energy buffer, security settings or (specific)
    storage resources of the input network to the output network.
-   When using the Relay when "pass-through" mode is off, and when passing all storage resources or specific storage
    resources, you can choose the filter mode, whether fuzzy mode is enabled, the access mode and the priority of the
    storage exposed to the output network.

-   As soon as a Security Manager is placed, the storage network will be locked down by default. Start adding Security
    Cards to allow or deny specific access to players.
-   To not lock the entire network by default for players who do not have a matching Security Card, a Fallback Security
    Card can be used to configure this behavior.
